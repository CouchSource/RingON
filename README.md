# RingON for Android

[RingON for Android] is a completely free and open source utility app that lets you set your phone ringer volume dynamically based on the position of the device. It uses your device sensors to detect 3 positions of your device -

- Device FACING UP
- Device FACING DOWN
- Device IN POCKET

RingON lets you set ringer volume with an option to vibrate on ring for all three positions of the device. It uses device Accelerometer, light and proximity sensors to detect positions of your device. It is light on battery too. The app smartly turns off battery consuming accelerometer sensor when not required..

Note: "Vibrate on Ring" option doesn't change the device setting. For this feature to work effectively you must uncheck "Vibrate when Ringing" option from your device settings.
